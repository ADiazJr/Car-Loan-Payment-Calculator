# Car-Loan-Payment-Calculator

Letâ€™s combine a few of the concepts that I have learned so far: conditionals, Boolean expressions, and arithmetic expressions.

In this project, I will write a program that will calculate the monthly car payment a user should expect to make after taking out a car loan. The program will include the following:

Car loan amount
Interest rate of the loan
Length of the loan (in years)
Down payment
